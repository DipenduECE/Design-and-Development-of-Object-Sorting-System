# Design-and-Development-of-Object-Sorting-System
In this paper, I have demonstrated how the sorting object functions using color sensor. The framework accomplishes this task with the help of connected microcontroller ATMega 328p in the Arduino UNO, a color detector TCS3200 that helps to color sensor which helps in sensing the color of the object that is placed in front of it.
